# GroceryProject
## Description
A grocery list that adopts the Dropbox concept: **any activity done by an user is automatically synchronized with all the users**. An user can add, edit, delete, check and uncheck anything on the list; if any change is made, all the users **connected to the same server** see their list updated.  
The program records the name of the person who created and checked the item.  
It uses the [OCSF framework] (http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~tcl/seg2105/coursenotes/Lab2_Getting_Started.html) and a Heroku database.  
The project has been made with the help of [Christine K](https://github.com/CKand). Thanks Christine! :)

## Instructions
* Extract the files in Eclipse
* Execute *ServerConsole.java*
* Execute *ClientConsole.java*
* Enter your name in the prompting window
* That's it!  

As the program uses an online database, if you're on a restricted network you might encounter some connection problems. In this case, consider using a VPN.
